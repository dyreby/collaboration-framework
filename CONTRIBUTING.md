I genuinely appreciate anyone willing to engage at this level: questions, challenges, different perspectives. Dialogue surfaces what we couldn't see alone.

That said, this is my model and I'm the one standing behind it. I'll be thoughtful about what fits, and I'll always do my best to explain my reasoning when something doesn't.

## How Concepts Evolve

**Issues capture misalignment.** When collaboration doesn't feel right, or a concept doesn't land the way I intended, I open an issue. The issue is the gap — what I observed vs what I meant.

**PRs capture resolution.** When a concept or profile feels right, it goes in a PR. The PR is the claim: this now says what I mean.

## What Goes Where

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Issue | Signal misalignment — what I observed vs what I intended |
| PR | Capture resolution — the concept or profile, ready to merge |

## Writing Style

**Concepts** — Approachable. Plain language. As detailed as they need to be.

**Profiles** — Precise. Compressed for purpose. Match the context they'll be used in.

## For Others

If you see something that doesn't make sense, please open an issue. I'll explain my reasoning or realize I need to clarify.
