# Contributing

I genuinely appreciate anyone willing to engage at this level: questions, challenges, different perspectives. Dialogue surfaces what we couldn't see alone.

That said, this is my model and I'm the one standing behind it. I'll be thoughtful about what fits, and I'll always do my best to explain my reasoning when something doesn't.

## How Concepts Evolve

**Issues capture misalignment.** When collaboration doesn't feel right, or a concept doesn't land the way I intended, I open an issue. The issue is the gap — what I observed vs what I meant.

**PRs capture resolution.** When a concept or profile feels right, it goes in a PR. The PR is the claim: this now says what I mean.

## What Goes Where

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Issue | Signal misalignment — what I observed vs what I intended |
| PR | Capture resolution — the concept or profile, ready to merge |
| RFC | Propose structural changes — see [docs/rfcs/](docs/rfcs/) |

Expectation alignment (concepts, profiles) flows through issues and PRs. Structural changes to the framework go through RFCs first.

## Writing Style

**Concepts** — Approachable. Plain language. As detailed as they need to be.

**Profiles** — Precise. Compressed for purpose. Match the context they'll be used in.

## Extensions

When adding a new extension, add it to `pi.extensions` in `package.json`. The manifest is explicit so users know what they're installing. We may publish to npm or JSR eventually, but for now installation is through git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/dyreby/collaboration-framework
```

## For Others

If you see something that doesn't make sense, please open an issue. I'll explain my reasoning or realize I need to clarify.
