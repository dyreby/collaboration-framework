# RFC-04: Foundation Extension

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Created:** 2026-02-15
- **Extends:** RFC-03 (Foundation Revision)

## Summary

Extend the Foundation from three truths to five, adding two truths that bridge objectives and world models and establish the structural advantage of simplicity.

## Motivation

RFC-03 established three truths:
- T-1: Agents act from objectives
- T-2: World models are incomplete, fallible, and mutable
- T-3: World input and conclusions are distinct

Through further analysis, we identified two gaps:

1. **Missing bridge**: T-1 and T-2 are independent claims. Nothing explicitly connects objectives to world models. We assumed agents *use* their world models to pursue objectives, but never stated it.

2. **Missing complexity claim**: We want to derive "simpler models are better" as a consequence, not a principle. But it's not derivable from T-1, T-2, T-3 alone. We need an explicit claim about complexity and input requirements.

### The Bridge Problem

To derive "a better world model leads to better outcomes," we need:
- T-1: Agents have objectives
- T-2: Agents have world models
- **Missing**: Agents *use* world models to select actions in pursuit of objectives

Without the bridge, T-1 and T-2 are disconnected. An agent could have objectives and a world model that don't interact.

### The Simplicity Problem

We want "simpler models are more robust" to be structural, not opinion. To derive it:
- T-2: Models are incomplete (always missing information)
- **Missing**: More complex models require more input to be useful

With this claim, the derivation follows: since models are always incomplete, and complex models require more input, simpler models are more robust to incompleteness.

## Proposal

### Extended Truths

**T-1: Objective-Driven Action** (unchanged)
Agents act from internal objectives.

**T-2: Imperfect World Model** (unchanged)
Agents have internal world models that are incomplete, fallible, and mutable.

**T-3: Model-Driven Action** (new)
Agents use their world models to select actions in pursuit of objectives.

- Connects T-1 (objectives) to T-2 (world models)
- Enables derivation: better model → better action selection → higher objective achievement
- This is structural, not opinion

**T-4: Input Distinction** (renumbered from T-3)
World input and model-derived conclusions are distinct. World input is taken as given.

**T-5: Model Complexity** (new)
More complex models require more input.

- A model with more parts needs more information to be useful
- This is definitional, not learned experience
- Combined with T-2 (incompleteness), simpler models are structurally advantaged

### What Changed from RFC-03

| RFC-03 | RFC-04 | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| T-1: Objectives | T-1: Objectives | Unchanged |
| T-2: World Model | T-2: Imperfect World Model | Unchanged |
| — | T-3: Model-Driven Action | New; connects objectives to world models |
| T-3: Input Distinction | T-4: Input Distinction | Renumbered |
| — | T-5: Model Complexity | New; enables "simpler is better" as structural consequence |

### Derived Consequences

These truths enable structural derivations:

**"Better model → better outcomes"**
- T-1: Agent has objectives
- T-2: Agent has (incomplete, fallible) world model
- T-3: Agent uses model to select actions in pursuit of objectives
- Derivation: More accurate model → better predictions → better action selection → higher probability of achieving objectives

**"Simpler models are more robust"**
- T-2: Models are always incomplete
- T-5: Complex models require more input
- Derivation: Since you never have complete information, models that require less information are more robust

**"Simplicity is structural advantage"**
- Follows from above
- Not a preference or principle — a consequence of T-2 + T-5

### Encoding for LLM Context

The five truths, encoded minimally:

```
## Truths

T-1: Agents act from internal objectives.

T-2: Agents have internal world models that are incomplete, fallible, and mutable.

T-3: Agents use their world models to select actions in pursuit of objectives.

T-4: World input and model-derived conclusions are distinct. World input is taken as given.

T-5: More complex models require more input.
```

## Discussion

### Why is "complex models require more input" a truth and not obvious?

It's definitional — what "more complex" means is "more parts" which means "more information needed." But it's not obvious that this should be stated as a foundation truth.

The reason to state it: without it, we can't derive "simpler is better" structurally. It would remain a principle (opinion about what works) rather than a consequence (logical derivation from truths).

### Why is the bridge a separate truth?

You could argue it's implied — why else would agents have world models if not to pursue objectives? But implications aren't derivations. Making it explicit means downstream reasoning doesn't have to re-derive it.

### Does the order matter?

The logical flow is:
1. Agents have objectives (why they act)
2. Agents have imperfect world models (what they work with)
3. Agents use models to pursue objectives (how 1 and 2 connect)
4. Input and conclusions are distinct (epistemic grounding)
5. Complex models need more input (complexity property)

T-3 immediately after T-2 connects objectives to models. T-4 establishes epistemic grounding. T-5 states the complexity property that, combined with T-2, yields the simplicity derivation.

## Migration

- This RFC extends RFC-03 (not supersedes — the original truths remain)
- ADR-04 will reference this RFC
- Version increments to v0.3.0
