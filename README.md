# Collaboration Framework

A framework for encoding how I think, so we can work together effectively.

## The Gap

What someone means and what they say are never quite the same. I've felt this: the frustration of being misunderstood, the effort it takes to explain myself clearly. I assume you've felt it too.

Neither of us can perfectly write what we mean. Neither can perfectly interpret what the other wrote. But here's what we can use: when we observe the result of our actions, we're the only ones who can decide "yes, that's what we meant" or "no, that missed the mark."

This gap can't be closed—but it can be worked with. That's what this framework is for.

## The Thesis

**Effective collaboration requires alignment at the right level—not more, not less.**

It's hierarchical: *why* → *what* → *how*. And each *how* contains its own why/what/how, all the way down.

At the top sits a shared objective. Below that, agreement on approach. Below that, agreement on implementation. Each level has the same shape: we each say what we think we should do and why, then agree or surface that we don't.

**Over-alignment creates noise.** A junior developer doesn't need the CEO's full strategic context, and couldn't use it. The right level for them is: this feature matters, build it well.

**Under-alignment creates gaps.** A developer who doesn't know *why* a feature matters will make poor tradeoffs when edge cases appear.

**The right level is discovered, not prescribed.** Step back to obvious agreement, then step down until we find where the work lives. That's where it becomes light.

Once we agree on *why*, disagreement on *what* becomes optimization, not conflict. Effort accumulates in the right direction. The *how* is encapsulated; each of us owns our approach within the agreed interface.

Perfect agreement is impossible. The system is designed to iterate and self-correct.

## How It Works

### Concepts

Concepts encode what something means to me: principles, preferences, ways of thinking. They live in [`concepts/`](concepts/) as freeform markdown files.

What isn't mentioned has no preference. If I say "tree," I mean just tree, not secretly hoping for oak. This keeps the vocabulary tractable: I'll try to only say something when silence would mislead.

### Iteration

Because expressed intent is lossy, working together needs a correction loop. OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) provides the structure:

1. **Observe** the result of our actions
2. **Orient** against what we meant (concepts help here)
3. **Decide** if it hit the mark or needs adjustment
4. **Act** accordingly—accept or iterate

This loop runs continuously. The [philosophy](docs/philosophy.md) has the formal treatment.

### In Practice

**In conversation**: I try to find the right level of alignment. When tension rises, it's usually a signal we're at the wrong level—not that we actually disagree. Stepping back often resolves it.

**With my coding agent**: Same approach, just formalized. It loads these concepts and we operate from shared understanding rather than repeated instructions.

**For you**: If we're working together, my hope is this helps us orient. And it's where I can say clearly: my intent is to help you.

The files aren't just agent context. They're readable documentation of how I think.

## Going Deeper

The [philosophy](docs/philosophy.md) captures the formal grounding: the presuppositions this model rests on and the truths that follow. You don't need it to work with me, but it's there if you want to see the derivation.

## Origins

This started as a way to work better with a coding agent. Along the way, I realized the same approach applies more broadly. The concepts that help an AI understand me help you understand me too.

The [RFCs](docs/rfcs/) and [ADRs](docs/adrs/) capture the evolution.

## Building This

I develop this framework with assistance from my coding agent, treating it like any other codebase I collaborate on.
