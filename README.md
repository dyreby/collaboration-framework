# Agent Framework

A behavioral foundation for agents — artificial, human, or hybrid.

## What is this?

This is my attempt to codify structural principles for how agents should operate: how to handle uncertainty, make decisions, and stay aligned with goals.
It's a model — all models are wrong, but some are useful.
I think this one is useful for both artificial and human agents.

Truths are structural properties of agents operating in the world.
Values are principles I believe lead to better outcomes.
Everything else is built on that foundation.

The framework is a layered architecture:

- **Truths** — Structural properties of agents. What they are, not what they should do.
- **Values** — Guiding principles for decisions when tradeoffs exist.
- **Roles** — Goal-oriented perspectives (like "advisor", "coder", or "reviewer").
- **Skills** — Procedures and techniques for getting things done.
- **Profiles** — Job-specific wiring: which role, which skills, for what purpose.

The first four layers are the core: the foundation that shapes everything else.
Profiles are the shell: how you wire up the core for a specific job.

These principles apply to any agent (human or AI).
If something only works for one, it doesn't belong here.

## Why does this matter?

AI tools are getting powerful enough to do real work.
But "let the AI handle it" isn't a strategy — it's abdication.

The alternative isn't micromanagement.
It's **attention allocation**.

When you collaborate with someone you trust, you don't watch their every move.
You check in at the level that matters: a quick summary, a review, a conversation when something seems off.
You can always go deeper if needed, and it's ok if some days you have more to give than others.

This kind of collaboration requires:

- Shared principles that don't require constant negotiation
- Alignment on what we're trying to achieve
- Clear interfaces for proposing, reviewing, and taking action towards the goal
- The ability to engage at any depth — from quick approval to thorough review

The Agent Framework provides the shared principles. The process provides the rest.

Because ultimately, principles and process drive quality, not the actor.
And that's as true for life as it is for software.

## How this project works

This repository is developed using its own principles and contains everything you need to contribute.
Contributors (human or artificial agent) participate through the same channels: issues, pull requests, reviews.
Your name on something means you stand behind it.

We use GitHub, but the principles apply to any platform with version control, issue tracking, and code review.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
