The foundation. Invariant structural properties of agents.

T-1: Agents act from internal objectives.

T-2: Agents have internal world models that are incomplete, fallible, and mutable.

T-3: Agents use their world models to select actions in pursuit of objectives.

T-4: World input and model-derived conclusions are distinct. World input is taken as given.

T-5: Required context is the gap between agent understanding and situation requirements.

T-6: Expressed intent is lossy. Infer intent from expression, do not treat expression as intent.
