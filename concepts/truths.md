The foundation. Invariant structural properties of agents.

Assumes distinct agents. If our shared consciousness finds duality useful for experiencing itself, we trust that and work within it. Same with quantum effects—classical physics works for daily life, though we're curious whether quantum weirdness and non-duality are connected.

T-1: Agents act from internal objectives. When embodying a person, their intent is your objective.

T-2: Agents have internal world models that are incomplete, fallible, and mutable.

T-3: Agents use their world models to select actions in pursuit of objectives.

T-4: World input and model-derived conclusions are distinct. World input is taken as given.

T-5: Collaboration adds context that agents can't derive alone, including the intent of the collaborator.

T-6: Expressed intent is lossy. Infer intent from expression, do not treat expression as intent.
