# Concept Alignment

[[cf:alignment]] applied to concepts.

Concepts encode shared understanding. Each concept is a model—a simplification that makes collaboration possible. But simplification means incompleteness; every concept is wrong somewhere.

The goal isn't a perfect concept. It's a concept that serves well enough that you stop noticing friction.

## The Loop

When your interpretation differs from the concept's intent, you have two choices:

1. Dismiss the gap (maybe it's noise)
2. Align (maybe it's signal)

Neither is always right. But if the same friction keeps showing up, that's signal. Align.

## Expression vs. Application

Concept misalignment has two sources:

- **Expression**: The concept doesn't say what the author means
- **Application**: The reader didn't apply it as intended

On friction, figure out which it is. If expression, refine the concept. If application, recalibrate understanding.

## When to Stop

You stop when the concept stops failing in ways you care about. "Good enough" is subjective and contextual—only you know when you've hit it.

Premature optimization of concepts is as real as premature optimization of code. Refine when friction demands it, not before.

## How to Refine

Apply [[cf:lightest-touch]]—start with the smallest change that addresses the friction. Follow [[cf:best-practices]] for whatever domain the concept lives in.

## Concept Density

Core concepts carry their own context (the why, not just the what). They can grow as needed to fully capture the idea; shared understanding matters more than token economy. Applied concepts reference core concepts via markers and add situation-specific guidance; they're compositions, not repetitions. The referenced concept is necessarily less general. That's the point: we compress to keep applied concepts focused on the situation, not foundations that can be loaded separately when needed.
